        <h1>Understanding Custom Elements and Web Components</h1>
        <p>Web development has evolved significantly over the years, with a strong emphasis on reusability and encapsulation. A key advancement in this area is the introduction of Web Components, a suite of different technologies allowing developers to create reusable custom elements and applications with encapsulated structure, style, and behavior. Among these technologies, Custom Elements stand out as a fundamental part of Web Components.</p>

        <h2>What are Web Components?</h2>
        <p>Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Web Components consist of three main technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Elements:</strong> APIs that let developers define new HTML elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadow DOM:</strong> Encapsulates style and markup in web components.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML Templates:</strong> HTML tags that allow the declaration of fragments of markup that go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later at runtime.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Custom Elements vs. Web Components</h2>
        <p>While "Web Components" refers to the overarching standard that encompasses Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates, "Custom Elements" specifically refer to one aspect of this standard. The key distinction lies in their scope and functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Elements</strong> focus solely on allowing developers to create new HTML tags and define their API (properties, methods, event handlers). They provide a way to extend the existing HTML vocabulary with your own elements, making the web more customizable and interactive.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Components</strong>, on the other hand, represent the bigger picture, including not just Custom Elements but also the encapsulation provided by Shadow DOM and the reusability afforded by HTML Templates. This trio of technologies together enables the creation of fully encapsulated and reusable components.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summary, while Custom Elements are a crucial part of Web Components, they represent only a fraction of the entire Web Components spectrum. Understanding the distinction and how to leverage both can significantly enhance the development of modern web applications, offering both encapsulation and reusability.</p>

        <p>For developers interested in diving deeper into Custom Elements and Web Components, resources like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> provide comprehensive guides and documentation.</p>

        <p>As the web evolves, embracing technologies like Web Components and Custom Elements is key to building robust, maintainable, and scalable web applications. They not only streamline the development process but also enhance the user experience with custom, interactive elements.</p>
